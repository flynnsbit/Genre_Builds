What is PictView?

  PictView is a mouse-driven viewer and converter of images. It runs on all
EGA, VGA,  SuperVGA and  Extended-VGA  video  adapters. PictView is able to
read images  stored in approximately  40 graphics  file formats and convert
them into  another format. All functions are extremely fast, up to 10 times 
faster than other programs.

Running PictView

PictView can be run in two modes, either with its menus, or from the
command line.

 Normal (menus) usage:

    Just type: PictView

 Command line usage:

  For detailed info, issue PictView.exe /?

  Examples:
    PictView  parrot.jpg
    PictView \users\johnp\images\parrot.jpg
    PictView c:image.tif 720
    PictView   bambus.bmp     640


 Command line syntax:

      PictView.EXE File [Width]

  File - a  name and an extension (may  include a path) of the  file to be
displayed.  PictView  automatically  chooses  the  best  graphics  mode to 
display the  image. You can influence  this mode selection if  you specify
the second optional parameter. This parameter is a number saying the width
in pixels  of the graphics  mode you  want  to display the  image in. This
number  can be  for example:  320  for  320x200 mode,  640 (640x480),  800
(800x600),  1024  (1024x768),  1152   (1152x864)  1280  (1280x1024),  1600
(1600x1200) or any other number, but  this mode width must be supported by
your video adapter !!



  I would  like to thank  Douglas Bashford  for his careful reading of all
texts  in this package  and corrections of my mistakes. Release of English
version of PictView would be impossible without his effort.


Running PictView within Windows


As a default, MS Windows don't  provide more XMS memory than 2MB. This may
be insufficient  for large images. I suggest you to create a shortcut (or
a PIF file in case of Win3.1; in fact, a shortcut is  represented by a PIF
file). Specify  concrete amount of memory you think would be engough. Just
start  with 2MB and if PictView  complains, increase the value and restart 
PictView.

Note:
 Some video  drivers for MSWin 95/98 under some circumintances don't allow
 DOS programs to use any SuperVGA mode.

Note:
 MS Windows NT from their nature do not allow DOS programs to use anything
 else than standard VGA modes.
